		<h2>INTRO TO JAWA</h2>
		<p>JAWA (Czech pronunciation: [java]) is a motorcycle and moped manufacturer founded in Prague, Czechoslovakia in 1929 by Frantisek Janecek, who bought the motorcycle division of Wanderer. The name JAWA was established by concatenating the first letters of Janecek and Wanderer. In the past, especially in the 1950s, JAWA was one of the top motorcycle manufacturers and exported its 350 into over 120 countries. Another famous model in the 1970s was the 350 Californian. It appeared in the typical black and red coloring from Californian beaches to New Zealand. After 1990, there was a significant loss of production. A successor company was formed in 1997 in Tynec nad Sazavou, continuing the name as JAWA Moto.</p>

		<h2>ORIGN</h2>
		<p>Frantisek Janecek started the company after working several years in the armament industry. Although he didn't have any experience with motorcycles, he was familiar with production techniques. Janecek chose between the Austrian double piston two-stroke motor of Puch, the Berlin two-stroke of Schliha, and the new Wanderer 500 & nbsp;cc. Janecek chose the Wanderer. Because of the collapse of the German motor industry, Wanderer had already decided to stop the production. This is because they didn't think it would be profitable to directly compete with BMW. The first model was introduced on October 23, 1929. This was a 500 cc 4-cycle engine with 12 kW of power (18 hp) and fuel consumption of 6 liters per 100 km. Although priced highly, through the first years (and several constructional fixes) this motorcycle was successful and was considered reliable.</p>
